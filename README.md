# cs590_chisel

These files include the following:

1. The various versions of the Delta Debugging as described in the paper. It is important to point out that the majority of the code is from the original CHISEL code from https://github.com/aspire-project/chisel by Kihong Heo, Woosuk Lee, Pardis Pashakhanloo, and Mayur Naik. I used their code as a basis and made alterations as described in my final report.

2. The files related to the final report.

3. The new examples/tests I created for conducting my experiments.
